Just one time:
make a fork
clone -> local 

secret + mgrate -> start project (superuser )

----------------

state 1:
no local changes

1- sync my fork (github)
2- (in local) git pull 
3- git checkout -b templates
(templates) 

if pr is merged:
branch -> delete from main repo


if you sync fork -> branch delete from fork 

local: git pull
main local is synced with main origin 


-> still my templates branch exist in local 

git branch -d tempaltes (delete)

again in templates 
git checkout -b new-branch
