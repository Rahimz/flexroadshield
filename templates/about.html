        <h2>Letâ€™s Make Wonders</h2>
        <h3>Modern Road Barriers</h3>
        <p>Reducing Accidents by cost effective engineering measures in accident hotspots is an important factor in road safety schemes and procedures. The extravagant costs of crashes on highways, main roads and side roads, has turned road safety improvement into one of the main concerns in transportation.</p>
        <p>The traditional road guardrails and panels have many shortcomings in protecting both human lives and safeguarding assets. With a goal of increasing road safety, we have designed a new type of road barrier that controls the impact acceleration in 3 consequent steps. In addition to decreased damage compared to the damage caused by hitting the ordinary guardrails and road panels, it is possible to redirect the vehicle to the main road after it hits FlexRoadShield panels.</p>
